#Notes of Chapter 10 (Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques)

 - application programs or database applications, and are used as canned transactions by the end users

- Most database systems have an interactive interface where these SQL commands can be typed directly into a monitor for execution by the database system

- Impedance mismatch is the term used to refer to the problems that occur because of differences between the database model and the programming language model.
like : 

1 - The first problem that may occur is that the data types of the programming language differ from the attribute data types that are available in the data model

2- the results of most queries are sets or multisets of tuples (rows), and each tuple is formed of a sequence of attribute values. In the program, it is often necessary to access the individual data values within individual
tuples for printing or processing. Hence, a binding is needed to map the query result data structure 

Impedance mismatch is less of a problem when a special database programming language is designed that uses the same data model and data types as the database model. One example of such a language is Oracleâ€™s PL/SQL. The SQL standard also
has a proposal for such a database programming language, known as SQL/PSM. For object databases, the object data model (see Chapter 12) is quite similar to the data
model of the Java programming language, so the impedance mismatch is greatly reduced when Java is used as the host language for accessing
