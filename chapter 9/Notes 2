Chapter  7  Notes  : 

* type attribute it the  attribute which tell us which subclass fro superclass we talk about

*Mapping  with EER  we have 4  options : 
1 - multiply relation superclass and subclass


*  the superclass would be as we know

* would have its own attribute(subclass)  and  the primary key or superclass 

* works for any  constrains whatever it was total or partial or d or o 


===================================================================================

2- multiply relation subclass  relation only 

* works well  when constrains  is d and total 

===================================================================================

3- single relation with one type 

*  this option is not recommened  if the local attributes are many that would make a lot of null value and would be preferable if attributes of subclass are not many 

* we provie type attribute to the attributes  also all attribute of subclasses 

* preferable  when it is d 

===================================================================================

4- single relation with multiply type attribute 


*  this option is not recommened  if the local attributes are many that would make a lot of null value and would be perferable if attributes of subclass are not many 

* add the whole attributes in  the superclass (single relation ) but we add new attribute  (flag true or false) for each subclass  to know if the memeber belongs to the both subclass or one of them 

* preferable  when it is O
