# Notes of chapter 14


The measurement   quality of each relation in our database depends on :

■ Making sure that the semantics of the attributes is clear in the schema
■ Reducing the redundant information in tuples
■ Reducing the NULL values in tuples
■ Disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples

wokring on reduntancy on our database to fix of wasted storage and cause update problem (insert -  delete - modification ) like null values

If many of the attributes do not apply to all tuples in the relation, we end up with many NULLs in those tuples. This can waste space at the storage level and may
also lead to problems with understanding the meaning of the attributes .


Normlization : The process  of decomposing unsatisfactory "bad " relations by breaking up their attribute into small relations

functional  dependencies : it is relation in attribute or more in the same table 


we have 6 types of normlizarion 

1 - 1st Normalization : when we remove attribute is multivalued attribute   or repeating groups (Nested relations) or composite attribute

build seprated table with primary key and the multivalued attribute or nested attributes

2 - 2nd Normalization : when we remove partial dependency , other attributes dependent on primary key attribute 

build seprated tables for each prime key with their dependcy attributes

3-  3rd Normalization  : when we remove Transitive dependency non primary attributes depends on non primary  attribute

Build  seprated table of those non primary attributes and make the one which dependent on  as prime

4- Boyce code normal form : it is like the 3rd form but doesn't allow if prime key depends on non prime key attribute

Build seprated table with prime attribute and the other attribute and make the other attribute prime in both seprated tables

5- 4th Normalization :  rare to use  , when we remove Multivalued Dependency ( having attributes in our table which are dependent and doesn't ahve any relate to each other like dependts(family) name and project name

Build seprated table for each   attribute with the main attribte  like  (employee name ) 

6 - 5th Normalization : rare ti use when we remove the Join dependency , when we have depenct attributes and all of them are prime and each one has its own relation with the other

build seprated table for each 2  of them
