#Notes of chapter 1 



We could have more different frame or view for diifferent users 


database has some feature which we work on like insert , delete , pop ... .etc

We have two section in database managed system like admin and user , admin can edit and change in database 
but user not 


database could be for long time like years 


asking about information in DB > Processing > MetaData >  Sorted data  then we reverse this operation to give information to  user


Metadata describes other data. It provides information about a certain item's content. For example, an image may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color depth, the image resolution



change in program doesnt depend change in data(program data independance)


Data abstraction  :  meaning that database shopoing sorted data and doesnt show it is sorted  and we used data model to make abstraction 


transaction some commands will run in parallel so It should be isolation and atomicity proprety (all  commands will  run or not all )
