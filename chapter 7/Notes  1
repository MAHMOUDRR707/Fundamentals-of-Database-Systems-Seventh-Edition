** Mapping  Notes 
 
 
*  composte attribute     we write its multi values not itself 

* Multi relation attribute  will have new realtion with the primary key of the enitity which it belong to 


*  when i have two  or more unique   keys i choose one only as primmary key 


* one to one  between 2 enitity   and there is an partial partcipition   then we take the enitity with parital and put its primary key as foign key in the  tuble of the other enitity


* if it one to many   ( هاخد اللي عنده ال 1  واحطه هو كفورين كي في التانية )



* if it many to many   you are gonna to create new table and also join if any attribute exist on relationship
