# Notes of chapter 12


 - this chapter, we discuss the features of objectoriented data models and show how some of these features have been incorporated in relational database systems and the SQL standard
 
 
- Another reason for the creation of object-oriented databases is the vast increase in the use of object-oriented programming languages for developing software applications. Databases are fundamental components in many software systems, and traditional databases are sometimes difficult to use with software applications that are
developed in an object-oriented programming language such as C++ or Java. Object databases are designed so they can be directly—or seamlessly—integrated with software that is developed using object-oriented programming languages

- An object typically has two components: state (value) and behavior (operations)

- OO databases store persistent objects permanently in secondary storage and allow the sharing of these objects among multiple programs and applications


- The internal structure of an object in OOPLs includes the specification of instance variables, which hold the values that define the internal state of the object. An
instance variable is similar to the concept of an attribute in the relational model
